> I am the voice of the customer, and I am the glue between engineering and marketing to drive interest and people trying our product

**I have a deep knowledge of the ethos, patterns and principles of Octopus Deploy and I understand its benefits for teams and the problems it solves**

* I am an authority on our customers: who they are, how they buy and why they pick Octopus (buying criteria).
* I understand the competitive landscape, and I work to be an expert on our competition and how they are positioned.
* I collaborate with engineering teams and marketing to develop product messaging and positioning that resonates with our customers (target personas).
* I understand and document our customerâ€™s buying process, including where they get information, and the who, what, when and why behind the decisions they make. Then drive changes to our sales and marketing processes based on what you learn.

**I help develop effective marketing campaigns/activities and monitor them so we can iterate**

* I help develop Octopus marketing campaigns and activities to support the retention of existing customers and the acquisition of new customers.
* I monitor the effectiveness of marketing activities on an ongoing basis and report back on required changes.

**I work with engineering, design, marketing and sales to promote releases and feature launches**
* I plan the launches of new features and larger releases and manage execution of the plan.
* I help act as an Octopus thought leader via speaking, video and written work (blog posts, tweets, docs etc.) 
* I understand and support our sales team and collaborate with them to produce content, videos, webinars, review blog posts etc.

**I am the glue between engineering and marketing** 

* I help the engineering team understand the value of marketing activities and work with them to plan feature launches, messaging and content.
* I help the marketing team understand software development, DevOps and deployment automation and their value
* I help the marketing team confidently update Octopus.com via code updates, pull requests, building and deploying.

**I oversee the content we produce, and I ensure it's right for our audience** 

* I am a gatekeeper (sanity-check) for our content (written, video, speaking etc.) and I ensure it's appropriate for our audience.
* I ensure we communicate inline with the Octopus Personality, i.e. we're friendly, human, genuine etc.
* I try to focus on why new features are valuable for our customers instead of what they do and how they work.
* I create content and collaborate with others to create content to generate new, high-quality leads consistently.
