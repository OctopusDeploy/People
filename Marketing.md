**I have a deep knowledge of the ethos, patterns and principles of Octopus Deploy and I understand its benefits for teams and the problems it solves**

* I am an authority on our customers being a developer myself, and understand what motivates them to choose Octopus
* I understand the competitive landscape, and I work to be an expert on our competition and how they are positioned.
* I collaborate with engineering teams and marketing to develop product messaging and positioning that resonates with our customers (target personas).
* I help dig beneath the surface of the evidence in our marketing tools to help our marketing team understand the real buying process.

**I help develop effective marketing campaigns/activities and monitor them so we can iterate**

* I help develop Octopus marketing campaigns and activities to support the retention of existing customers and the acquisition of new customers.
* I monitor the effectiveness of marketing activities on an ongoing basis and report back on required changes.

**I work with engineering, design, marketing and sales to promote releases and feature launches**
* I plan the launches of new features and larger releases and manage execution of the plan.
* I help act as an Octopus thought leader via speaking, video and written work (blog posts, tweets, docs etc.) 
* I understand and support our sales team and collaborate with them to produce content, videos, webinars, review blog posts etc.

**I am the glue between engineering and marketing** 

* I help the engineering team understand the value of marketing activities and work with them to plan feature launches, messaging and content.
* I help the marketing team understand software development, DevOps and deployment automation and their value
* I help the marketing team confidently update Octopus.com via code updates, pull requests, building and deploying.

**I oversee the content we produce, and I ensure it's right for our audience** 

* I am a gatekeeper (sanity-check) for our content (written, video, speaking etc.) and I ensure it's appropriate for our audience.
* I ensure we communicate inline with the Octopus Personality, i.e. We're friendly, human, genuine and you can't "smell the marketing"
* I try to focus on why new features are valuable for our customers instead of what they do and how they work.
* I create content and collaborate with others to create content to generate new, high-quality leads consistently.
