- I can contribute meaningfully to a conversation about any area in Octopus both inside and outside R&D.
- I participate heavily in early-stage decision making activities with other principal engineers and teams. The business context and technical knowledge I bring to these conversations leads to higher quality decisions being made.
- I own the definition of our product‚Äôs target architecture, using a holistic view of our engineering organisation, product, customer insights, and business goals to articulate and prioritise the architectural shifts necessary to achieve those goals within a written target architecture.
- I ensure product architecture and implementation decisions being made by teams are aligned with our target architecture.

<summary>Examples</summary>

- I provided ongoing guidance to a principal and lead engineer as they developed our new execution pipeline, using my expertise of the existing execution pipeline and target architecture to provide critical, timely feedback.
- I championed and led the definition of a target architecture for Octopus Server, knowing that doing so would unlock our ability to more effectively execute the architectural shifts required at scale by enabling engineers to reason about target architecture in their day-to-day work.
- I helped validate plans for a new commercial stack with our VP Product, using my knowledge of Octopus Server and cloud architecture to support designs for product experience changes, and discussing buy / build tradeoffs for the major components involved.

<summary>Examples</summary>

- Kicking off a large initiative to deliver a large migration with a third of our engineering team contributing, I devised a set of tools and activities to quickly form and bond strong teams and align them with the work to be done, driving immediate momentum in those teams, and resulting in completing the work to be done within half the originally estimated budget.
- When one of our teams shipped an RFC that triggered a strong reaction across R&D, I intervened and facilitated a workshop with that team and RFC respondents to align the parties on key principles, then helped broker consensus that would help us achieve the outcomes stated within the RFC.
