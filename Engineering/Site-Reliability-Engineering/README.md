# Site Reliability Engineering Roles

Our site reliability engineering roles are defined by expectations for each level in terms of:
-   **Planning horizon**: The typical timeframe to be thinking ahead about your impacts
-   **Impact radius**: The number of people or teams typically impacted by your work
-   **Evaluated by**: The person typically accountable for evaluating your performance
-   **Responsibility and direction needed**: The expected degree of autonomy at that level

...and in each of the following dimensions:

-   🦉 Domain expertise
-   🌱 Teaching and Mentoring
-   🧭 Culture and Leadership
-   🏆 Customer Success

The following pages provide demonstrable values and concrete examples to describe these expectations:

1. [L2: Site Reliability Engineer](L2-Site-Reliability-Engineer.md)
2. [L3: Senior Site Reliability Engineer](L3-Senior-Site-Reliability-Engineer.md)
3. [L4: Staff Site Reliability Engineer](L4-Staff-Site-Reliability-Engineer.md)

💡 Tip: To help guide conversations about your progression with your manager, open multiple tabs and contrast the expectations across adjacent levels.

# What are SREs?
SREs understand software systems are not just a pile of code. They understand its purpose, the machinery used to run it, how it's managed and that reliable operations require humans to collaborate rather than individual heroism.

They help teams to make the right reliability trade offs. They understand how to measure how well a system is running, identify the high leverage points and move them to improve the outcomes, costs and/or manage risks. 

They are experts in learning and sharing, from both what works and doesn't, are unfazed by chaos, and they will calmly and practically get problems fixed.

They often thrive in busy operational environments, which further amplifies their desire to automate and build reliable systems which turn into reliable platforms. 

They likely find lessons from aviation safety culture to be interesting and relevant to their daily work. They're equally comfortable leading a postmortem as they are designing a deployment and monitoring pipeline.

## Picking between Software Engineering and SRE
For engineers deciding between the two ladders - SREs are engineers who care more about 
making other engineer's code work well than writing the code themselves. More so than Software Engineers, SREs err towards automating problems away and are comfortable jumping into 
the code we run including the tools we use. SREs often have Software Engineering backgrounds, and use that background to apply Software Engineering thinking to operational reliability problems.
