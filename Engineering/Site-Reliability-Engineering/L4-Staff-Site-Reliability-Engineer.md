# L4: Staff Site Reliability Engineer

> _I am a well-rounded engineer, architect and problem solver. I can be trusted to take a brand new idea from inception to production, bringing people along with me throughout the process and providing clarity for our team. I am trusted to autonomously lead people through complex cross-team reliability problems with a proven record of delivering ideas from inception to their successful completion._ 

- **Planning horizon**: 6-12 months
- **Impact radius**: Group, and individual teams outside the group by consultation.
- **Evaluation**: Manager or Director
- **Responsibility and direction needed**: I proactively identify threats to reliability across the company, and lead the work required to mitigate them with limited supervision.

## 🦉 Domain expertise

- Within my group:
  - I am a well-rounded engineer, architect and problem solver
  - I am an expert in many domains of reliability engineering, as well as in my team's area of ownership.
  - I am comfortable diving head-first into moderately risky situations with relatively little upfront information and oversight
  - I am confident in making architectural decisions, taking cross-cutting concerns (for example, infrastructure, identity management, security, scalability, concurrency, reliability and maintainability) into consideration as appropriate.
  - I stay up to date on evolving platform and reliability engineering standards, platform features, and critical vendor and community-provided technologies.
  maybe:
  - I have a deep understanding of the technical direction of my teams within my group so I can detect and correct issues early.
  - I understand the general technical direction of other teams at Octopus so I can detect and correct issues early.
  - I manage operational risks effectively, and architect to reduce operational risk.
- Across Octopus:
  - I consult with teams to help make critical product architecture and implementation decisions that result in better reliability outcomes.
  - I have a broad understanding of the Octopus technical strategy and target architecture.
  - I contribute to the engineering standards and principles used across Octopus.

<summary>Examples</summary>

- I successfully completed a large, complex project with multiple components and stakeholders beyond my immediate team.
- I dived head-first into an incident in an area of significant technical ambiguity or risk, led the investigation and resolved the issue by removing noise around the incident, to allow the incident response team to solve the issue.
- I strive for automation by coding it or by leading and influencing engineers and developers to build systems that are easy to observe and run in production.
