# Octopus People

This repo describes the culture we strive for as Octopus, recognising our culture is the sum product of our people.

It seeks to describe some **defining characteristics** about each role at Octopus, and provide some concrete **examples** along the way.

It's the anchor point used through all of our feedback and promotion cycles.

It's a living document, maintained by the very people it affects.

## Background and Purpose

- I want to provide a simple breakdown of what I value most about people in Octopus in the hope that most of us agree.
- I want this to read as a either a narrative or as a reference.
- I want to use language that promotes personal ownership.
- I want to use language people can identify with: more human than human resources.
- I want people to be inspired to grow personally just by reading through this.
- I want people to feel like this is achievable.
- I want this to be helpful for personal and team retrospectives.
- I want this to help when recommending people for hire, promotion, and recognition.
- I want people to collaborate on this as a living statement: it's maintained by the very people it affects.
