- I can confidently step outside my own comfort zone and adapt quickly to new technologies.
- I am able to design and model data, to improve re-usability and eliminate complexity from the data-platform.
- I make appropriate scaling, reliability, and maintenance trade-offs as they occur in practice.
- I identify, qualify and reduce technical debt as appropriate to my team's priorities.
- I have a solid understanding of how code and systems are deployed to production (Equivalent to L2 Software Engineer).

- I took on a significant share of unplanned work and other "housekeeping" tasks.
- I put more technical concepts (e.g. data-models) into clear business language to facilitate the business outcomes and requirements expected for a project.
- I spotted a contentious issue that could have gone badly and facilitated everyone toward a decision that resolved the situation.

- I ship ideas from conception to production of high quality.
- I build data-products that translate insight into action for stakeholders.
- I advocate for stakeholder needs and motivations.
- I decompose larger requirements into smaller, more manageable pieces, to deliver functionality in an incremental and iterative manner.
- I build requirements and technical recommendations based on the real needs of stakeholders, that are verifiably accurate and reliable.

<summary>Examples</summary>

- I led a shaped pitch from idea to production
- I gave an early access version to our stakeholders to get feedback during development, and acted on that feedback.
- I helped unblock the delivery pipeline to make sure we could verify the expected behaviour of the changes we made to production.
- I analyzed data to make technical and scope decisions during project planning and rollout.
- I gave our stakeholder a suitable time for when an issue would be resolved, once confirming it wasn't urgent / suitable workarounds existed.
