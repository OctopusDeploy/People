# Data Engineering Roles

Our data engineering roles are defined by expectations for each level in terms of:
-   **Planning horizon**: The typical timeframe to be thinking ahead about your impacts
-   **Impact radius**: The number of people or teams typically impacted by your work
-   **Evaluated by**: The person typically accountable for evaluating your performance
-   **Responsibility and direction needed**: The expected degree of autonomy at that level

...and in each of the following dimensions:

-   🦉 Domain expertise
-   🌱 Teaching and Mentoring
-   🧭 Culture and Leadership
-   🏆 Customer Success

The following pages provide demonstrable values and concrete examples to describe these expectations:
