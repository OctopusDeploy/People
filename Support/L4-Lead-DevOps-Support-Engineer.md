# L4: Lead DevOps Support Engineer

> I am a trusted leader on the Support team. Through my judgment, initiative, and technical depth, I set a clear example. I help others do their best work by shaping how we support customers, improving our systems and processes, and building strong connections with other teams.

## Impact

- I collaborate closely with Engineering, Product, and Customer teams to improve support outcomes  
- I mentor and guide others, helping them grow and succeed in their roles  
- I influence priorities, process, and direction across the support function and beyond  

## I lead complex technical support work and improve the system around it

- I handle the most complex or sensitive customer issues, and I support others in doing the same  
- I identify and address recurring issues through tooling, documentation, or cross-team initiatives  
- I shape support workflows and make it easier for the whole team to deliver high-quality outcomes  
- I balance technical, customer, and business needs when solving problems or recommending changes  
- I support operational excellence, performance, and reliability across the support function  

## I grow people and multiply the team's impact

- I coach others in their thinking, communication, and decision-making  
- I give clear, actionable feedback that helps people develop  
- I guide others through ambiguity and complexity with empathy and clarity  
- I help the team stay focused on what matters most - technically and strategically  

## I influence how the wider organisation supports our customers

- I work with peers across Octopus to improve how we handle support, feedback, and quality  
- I contribute to shared understanding between Support and other teams  
- I shape the way we think about customer experience, quality, and success  
- I represent Support thoughtfully and constructively in broader company discussions
