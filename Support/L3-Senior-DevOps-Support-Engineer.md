# L3: Senior DevOps Support Engineer

> I am a trusted expert and a calm, thoughtful problem solver. I consistently deliver high-quality support, lead by example, and help raise the bar across the team. I balance deep technical understanding with strong communication and judgement, and I work across teams to improve how we support our customers.

## Impact

- I take ownership of complex issues, often involving multiple teams or systems  
- I work directly with Engineering, Product, or Customer teams to resolve problems or drive improvements  
- I proactively share knowledge and help others level up through mentoring, pairing, or thoughtful reviews  

## I deliver impactful, technically sound support

- I independently investigate and resolve complex or ambiguous issues  
- I act with urgency and clarity on customer-impacting problems  
- I deeply understand the systems I support and help others do the same  
- I regularly contribute improvements to tooling, processes, or documentation  
- I write with empathy, care, and precision - balancing technical detail with customer needs  

## I lead through expertise, initiative, and collaboration

- I help shape support workflows and improve how we triage, escalate, and solve problems  
- I guide less experienced team members with humility and generosity  
- I actively share knowledge across the company through documentation, sessions, or discussions  
- I notice what needs doing and take initiative to make it better, technically or operationally  

## I shape team culture and decision making

- I raise the standard of how we communicate, support each other, and support our customers  
- I take ownership and follow through, especially when things are unclear or hard  
- I help the team navigate change, ambiguity, and difficult trade-offs  
- I model inclusive, thoughtful behaviour and bring out the best in others
