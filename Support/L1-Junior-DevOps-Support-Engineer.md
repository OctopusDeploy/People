# L1: Junior DevOps Support Engineer

> I am a motivated and thoughtful member of the Support team. I’m building confidence in my technical skills, communication, and judgement, and I bring curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a strong desire to support our customers and team.




## Impact

- I focus on helping our customers by working directly with the Support team  
- I collaborate with teammates to learn and solve problems together  
- I may interact with other teams occasionally, usually with guidance from more experienced team members  

## I provide helpful, accurate support with increasing independence

- I’m learning the fundamentals of how our product set works and how to troubleshoot customer problems  
- I write clear, respectful, and accurate responses to customers, with guidance as needed  
- I’m becoming comfortable using our tools and processes, and I ask good questions when I get stuck  
- I document what I learn to help others and build shared team knowledge  
- I prioritise tasks with help from my team, and I keep people informed about my progress  


## I grow by learning from others and reflecting on feedback

- I ask questions and seek feedback to understand how I can improve  
- I take time to understand the systems I’m supporting, rather than just following instructions  
- I actively look for opportunities to improve my knowledge of Octopus, Codefresh and the DevOps/GitOps space  
- I share my learning and ideas with the team, even if they’re early or imperfect  

## I contribute to a kind, inclusive, and effective team

- I’m respectful, thoughtful, and helpful in all my interactions  
- I work with others to solve problems and improve how we do support  
- I bring positive energy, take responsibility for my work, and follow through on commitments
