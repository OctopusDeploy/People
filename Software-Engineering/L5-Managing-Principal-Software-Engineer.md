# L5: Managing Principal Software Engineer

> _We do not expect more openings for this role; you should choose one of the [Software Engineering](README.md) or [Engineering Management](../Engineering-Management.md) ladders instead._

## Expectations

This role combines some technical and management responsibilities, as follows:

* Includes the expectations of a [Senior Engineering Manager](../Engineering-Management.md#l5-senior-engineering-manager) (EM), but applied to a team of ~1-5 direct reports rather than up to ~10
* Includes the expectations of a [Principal Software Engineer](L5-Principal-Software-Engineer.md) (PE), but for a narrower domain 

The qualifications above intend to describe realistic constraints within which someone could be both a great EM and great PE for the people in their team. For more details, refer to the individual ladders linked above, keeping these constraints in mind. 

## History

In 2020, this role combining a hybrid of technical and management responsibilities was introduced under the name “Engineering Manager”. This role has been renamed to Managing Principal Software Engineer, to disambiguate it from the distinct [technical](README.md) and [management](../Engineering-Management.md) ladders that were introduced in 2021.

## Usage 

There are only limited scenarios where this role is the best option, because of the broad range of responsibilities being asked of one individual. Risks include:

1. Difficult to hire into
2. May limit depth of specialization in either individual contribution or management track
3. More difficult to set expectations
4. Limits team size

One scenario where this role may be suitable is when a PE with management experience spearheads a new initiative, with that individual taking on both the management and technical leadership of an initially small team and narrow domain. EM responsibilities may then transition to an incoming peer as the team or domain grows.

## Career progression

This is an L5 role and is paid according to the same salary calculator as Software Engineers and Engineering Managers. We are not planning on creating a full career track for this hybrid role. Career progression from this role is possible by moving sideways or upwards via the separate [Software Engineering](README.md) or [Engineering Management](../Engineering-Management.md) ladders.
