## Junior Software Engineer / Software Engineer

_We avoid distinguishing too much between the Junior Software Engineer and Software Engineer. These roles are primarily focused on learning with the aim to grow into the contribution of a Senior Software Engineer or beyond. The primary indicator inside these levels is how far you are along your journey from dependent contribution to independent contribution._
