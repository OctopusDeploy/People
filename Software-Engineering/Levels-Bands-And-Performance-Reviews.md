## Levels, Bands, and Performance Reviews

Our career and compensation philosophy are carefully designed to help everyone at Octopus do the best work of their life and feel a genuine sense of progression while we work together. If you haven't already, jump across and learn the fundamentals of our career and compensation philosophy in our [handbook](https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/career).

Summarising, we want to ensure that:
- Our salaries pass the "printer test" (same job, same pay)
- We support both "superstars" seeking a steep growth trajectory and "rockstars" seeking a shallower growth trajectory
- We have roles and levels that set clear expectations between individuals across Octopus

Octopus People (this repository) is a core building block we use to help people navigate their career at Octopus and one area that deserves a bit more explanation is job levels and bands and how we use performance reviews at Octopus.

In short:
- **Level** (i.e. L1-5) is used to set the person's role title (e.g. Junior Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer), to broadcast expectations and reinforce archetypes, to the person, across Octopus and beyond.
- **Band** (i.e. Maturing/Performing/Exceeding) is used to reflect value contributed within that level and provide a sense of progression within each level and smoother transitions to the next level
- **Performance Reviews** are an opportunity for you and your manager to reflect on your demonstrated performance against the expectations of that level + band, and determine whether you are ready for a promotion to the next level/band.

### Understanding bands

While levels are pretty easy to understand since they are tied directly to a definition in Octopus People, we've seen some people struggle to calibrate on what the bands mean. This section is designed to help everyone calibrate on the meaning of each band, *maturing*, *performing*, and *exceeding*.

#### Maturing

The Maturing band is suitable for someone who is _immediately ready_ to _largely_ deliver on the expectations of that level, but needs further coaching or support before they are fully performing in 1 or more dimensions (i.e. ü¶â Domain expertise, üå± Teaching and Mentoring, üß≠ Culture and Leadership or üèÜ Customer Success).

Use these tests to check if someone is ready for a promotion to Maturing at the next level:

1. _Would you be proud to introduce that person for the first time to someone on another team, as an unsurprising example of what to expect from an "L(N+1) Engineer" (e.g. "Senior Engineer")_?
2. _Do you and the person have a shared understanding of the gap to get to Performing at that next level, and are you both up to the challenge to put that plan into action_?
3. _Have you lined up the opportunities that person will need to demonstrate they can get to Performing at that next level?_

There is no hard and fast rule for a maximum duration that someone can be in a Maturing band. The important thing is that the manager is confident about the person's growth trajectory toward Performing. If this confidence is lost, the manager and person should discuss moving back to Exceeding in the previous level.

To progress from the Maturing band to the Performing band at a particular level, someone will typically need to have demonstrated a track record of performing at that level autonomously and without requiring significant support from their manager to do so.

#### Performing

The Performing band should be considered the default and is for everyone who typifies what it means to be a great contributor at that level at Octopus.

#### Exceeding

The Exceeding band is a tool that managers can use when they need to recognize value contributed significantly _above and beyond_ what is expected at their level. _Above and beyond_ is typically demonstrated by exhibiting behaviours from the level above, or by operating with an impact radius larger than that expected in their current role, while continuing to perform the requirements of their current level effectively.

This should usually only apply to:

1. someone who doesn't _want_ to be promoted to the next level with its associated expectations (e.g. a "rockstar" at L3 or above who prefers a shallower growth trajectory), or
2. someone who is ready for the next level, but doesn't yet have a chance to demonstrate they can meet expectations at that level (note: in a growing company, this should be a short-term situation)
