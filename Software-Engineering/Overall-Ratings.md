### Deriving an overall rating

At performance review time, you and your manager can follow this process for deriving an overall level and salary band (i.e. Maturing, Performing, or Exceeding):

1.  Open up the description for your current (or next) level
2.  For each dimension (i.e. Domain Expertise, Teaching & Mentoring, etc):
    1.  Consider the values and examples listed in that dimension holistically. The examples are not a "checklist" of discrete things that an engineer must demonstrate to progress, but rather together with the values should paint a more vivid picture of the sort of behaviors and impact that an engineer at each level is expected to have.Â 
    2.  Talk to your manager to understand whether you are "Maturing", "Performing", or "Exceeding" at your level in that dimension
    3.  If you are "Maturing" in that dimension, work with your manager to understand how you're progressing and put together a coaching plan if necessary
4.  Your manager is responsible for deriving your overall rating, in line with our [calibration](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RND/pages/2236940315/Engineering+calibration+process) and [promotion](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RND/pages/2236710937/Engineering+promotion+process) processes (internal links). Here are some rules of thumb to help your manager execute this step, for a given level:
    1.  Engineers who are "Maturing" in any dimension tend to be "Maturing" overall
    2.  Engineers who are "Performing" in every dimension are "Performing" overall
    3.  Engineers who are "Exceeding" in 3 or more dimensions tend to be "Exceeding" overall
