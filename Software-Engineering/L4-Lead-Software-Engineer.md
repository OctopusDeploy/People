## Lead Software Engineer

> I am a well-rounded developer, architect and problem solver. I can be trusted to take a brand new idea from inception to production, bringing people along with me throughout the process and providing clarity for our team. I am trusted to autonomously lead people through complex problems with a proven record of delivering ideas from inception to their successful completion. A Lead Software Engineer encompasses all of the qualities listed in [Leadership](../Leadership.md).

### I am trusted to ship a brand new idea to production with limited supervision

- I can confidently step outside my comfort zone and adapt quickly to new situations.
- I am comfortable diving head-first into moderately risky situations with relatively little upfront information and oversight.
- I am confident making architectural decisions taking concerns like infrastructure, identity management, security, scalability, concurrency, and maintainability into consideration.
- I am comfortable with transparently assessing risk, making recommendations, escalating appropriately, and dealing with the consequences along the way.
- I am comfortable building a product vision based on the needs of multiple customers, regardless of whether this involves technology or otherwise.
- I can confidently and charismatically pitch ideas, positively influencing and convincing people to take decisive action based on reaching consensus.
- I am an adept communicator, and can effectively steer technical and non-technical conversations to positive outcomes over any medium.

### I help our team focus on delivering value to our customers

- I invest in sustainable delivery, maintaining professional standards and striking a pragmatic balance between idealistic purity and business pressures.
- I am typically the first to take responsibility for reducing waste in our process.
- I am comfortable performing business analysis work. I help clarify our product vision and turn it into an ordered product backlog, or other form of requirements, collaborating with others to reach a shared understanding of what should be built, including acceptance criteria.
- I recognise problems and proactively engage with other people to prevent or resolve them quickly.

### I am investing back into Octopus

- I am known as someone who looks for opportunities to invest back into Octopus.
- I am actively involved in the retrospective process, and I am comfortable challenging and coaching my peers.
- I am mentoring another engineer, deliberately helping them to round out their skill set.
- I am sharing my on-the-job learning and experiences with others so they can be more effective in their roles, making sure others understand the solution throughout the process.

### I am trusted to lead a team of diverse technical roles (from Software Engineers, Product Designers, and Quality Coaches) to ship shaped pitches to production

- I am a well-rounded leader of people, known for having a collaborative leadership style.
- I structure my work according to these priorities: coordinate, communicate, then contribute.
- I understand our organisation structure and how we schedule work (ShapeUp, QRF, etc) and I help my team be net-positive contributors in this environment.
- I understand our fixed-time/high-quality/variable-scope approach to software projects and I make good tradeoffs using tools like the "scope hammer" and "safety nets".
- I am comfortable with transparently assessing risk, making recommendations, escalating appropriately, and dealing with the consequences along the way.
- I can confidently and charismatically pitch ideas, positively influencing my team to take decisive action based on reaching consensus.
- I am an adept communicator, and can effectively steer technical and non-technical conversations to positive outcomes over any medium.
