# L5 Senior Engineering Manager

> I am an experienced Engineering Manager that leads one or more teams of engineers to deliver direct business impact. My manager can "set and forget" when it comes to my team, knowing that I can solve most problems independently using a robust managerial toolbox, and will keep them in the loop.

I encompass all of the qualities listed in the L4 Engineering Manager definition, and I build on them in the following ways.
