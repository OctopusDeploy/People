# L4 Engineering Manager

> I am an Engineering Manager that leads a team of engineers to deliver direct business impact. I require some support from my manager to solve difficult management problems that are beyond my current experience level.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Leadership
I take accountability for the engineers in my team, the way they work, and the results they deliver.
- I follow through on my commitments and take accountability for my work and the work of my team 
- When it comes to team planning, I’m responsible for bringing my unique knowledge of the people on our team, headcount constraints, and other people-related matters
- I empower my team to get things done and I drive results collaboratively.
- I clarify the goals, roles, and execution plans for my team.

## :deciduous_tree: Managing Individuals
I take accountability for the engineering talent on my team and their career growth.
- I can effectively resolve issues with underperformers with some guidance from my manager
- I can confidently and proactively coach engineers up to senior (L3) level, accelerating them along their personal growth trajectory. I can coach engineers beyond senior (L3) level with support from my manager
- I give direct feedback which is timely, actionable, and helpful. The feedback I give in performance reviews is rarely a surprise because it summarises the timely, actionable, and helpful feedback my teammate has been receiving.
- I am learning how to think about the talent on my team strategically: how to create growth opportunities for team members while addressing gaps and risks through recruiting, training, and performance management
- I structure my team so the right people are in the right roles with clearly defined responsibilities. In consultation with my manager, I ensure projects are staffed appropriately to set them up for success, placing my strongest technical leaders where they are the most needed and impactful
