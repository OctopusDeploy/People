## Deriving an overall rating (Maturing, Performing, Exceeding)

We use Maturing, Performing, or Exceeding bands within each level to help us ensure that:

- Our salaries pass the [printer test](https://handbook.octopus.com/life-octopus/career#compensation-philosophy)
- We support both "superstars" seeking a steep growth trajectory and "rockstars" seeking a shallower growth trajectory
- We have role titles that set clear expectations between individuals across Octopus

In short:

- **Level** (i.e. L1-5) is used to set the person's role title (e.g. Solutions Engineer, Senior Solutions Engineer, Solutions Architect), to broadcast expectations and reinforce archetypes, to the person, across Octopus and beyond.
- **Band** (i.e. Maturing/Performing/Exceeding) is used to reflect value contributed within that level, and thereby help us pass the printer test.

### Maturing

The Maturing band is suitable for someone who is _immediately ready_ to _largely_ deliver on the expectations of that level, but needs further coaching or support before they are fully performing in 1 or more dimensions (i.e. ü¶â Domain expertise, üå± Teaching and Mentoring, üß≠ Culture and Leadership or üèÜ Customer Success).

Use these tests to check if someone is ready for a promotion to Maturing at the next level:

1. _Would you be proud to introduce that person for the first time to someone on another team, as an unsurprising example of what to expect from an "L(N+1) Engineer" (e.g. "Senior Engineer")_?
2. _Do you and the person have a shared understanding of the gap to get to Performing at that next level, and are you both up to the challenge to put that plan into action_?
3. _Have you lined up the opportunities that person will need to demonstrate they can get to Performing at that next level?_

There is no hard and fast rule for a maximum duration that someone can be in a Maturing band. The important thing is that the manager is confident about the person's growth trajectory toward Performing. If this confidence is lost, the manager and person should discuss moving back to Exceeding in the previous level.

### Performing

The Performing band should be considered the default, and is for everyone who typifies what it means to be a great contributor at that level at Octopus.

### Exceeding

The Exceeding band is a tool that managers can use when they need to recognize value contributed significantly _above and beyond_ what is expected at their level. This should usually only apply to:

1. someone who doesn't _want_ to be promoted to the next level with its associated expectations (e.g. a "rockstar" who prefers a shallower growth trajectory), or
2. someone who is ready for the next level, but doesn't yet have a chance to demonstrate they can meet expectations at that level (note: in a growing company, this should be a short-term situation)
